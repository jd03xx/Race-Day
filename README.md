Design the logic for an app that will give runners information on race day

# Usage

This program will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.
Race day timeline is:

- 0930: Adult and registered early
- 1100: Adult and registered late
- 1230: All youth

The adult runners(over 18) and youth runners (under 18) can register early or late and are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.
Runners who are 18 years of age are prompted to see the registration desk.

Race Number:

- Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000
- All others receive a number below 1000

Start Time:

- Adult registrants run at 0930 or 1100
  - Early adults run at 0930
  - Late adults run at 1100
- Youth registrants run at 1230(regardless of registration)
